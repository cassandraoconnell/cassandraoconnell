I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable and engaging web applications.

I love taking on new technical challenges and thrive on solving unique software problems. I architect applications to be built on a solid foundation, ensuring they run smoothly at scale while allowing for quick iteration. My expertise lies in front-end software architecture and performance optimization, but I have experience writing code across the stack.âš¡

I love Rust, Typescript, React, and WebAssembly. I especially love putting all those things together!
