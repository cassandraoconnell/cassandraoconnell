Iâ€™m a software engineer focused on well-architected and performant systems that are just as reliable as they are engaging. I love a technical challenge and thrive solving unique software problems. My code is clean and maintainable and I make sure to write coherent tests to accompany it. âš¡

I love Rust, Typescript, React, and WebAssembly. I especially love putting all those things together!
